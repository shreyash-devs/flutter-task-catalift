This is a placeholder file for the app icon.

For a real app, you would place a 1024x1024 PNG file named 'appicon.png' in this directory.
Since we can't create the image here directly, you would need to:

1. Create a square PNG image with your app logo
2. Name it 'appicon.png'
3. Place it in the assets/icon/ directory
4. Run: flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

For now, the app will fall back to using the default Flutter icon or a simple fitness icon
as configured in the splash screen.
